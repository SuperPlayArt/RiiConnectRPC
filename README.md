# RiiTag-RPC

With RiiTag-RPC, you can show what you're playing on your Wii on Discord. You need to set up a RiiTag at https://tag.rc24.xyz/ (that's where it gets its magic from), link RiiTag with your Wii, then open up Discord and the RiiTag-RPC program. The program will guide you through the rest of the steps to log in, and it'll work like magic! It automatically checks when you're playing a game and not display the rich presence when you're not.
